# Plugins

RequireJS allows you to write loader plugins that can load different types of resources as dependencies, and even include the dependencies in optimized builds.

Existing loader plugins are the text! and i18n! plugins. The text! plugin handles loading text, and the i18n plugin handles loading a JavaScript object that is made up from objects from a few different modules. The object contains localized strings.

## Plugin Names

Loader plugins are just another module, but they implement a specific API. You can reference your plugin by putting its module name before a ! in the dependency. For instance, if you create a plugin with the name "foo.js", you would use it like so:

    require(['foo!something/loaded/by/foo'], function (somethingFooLoaded) {
        //Use somethingFooLoaded was something the foo.js file loaded given the
        //string 'something/loaded/by/foo'.
    });

So, the plugin's module name comes before the ! separator. The part after the ! separator is called the <b>resource name</b>. The resource name may look like a normal module name. THe plugin's module name can be any valid module name, so for instance, you could use a relative indicator:

    require(['./foo!something/loaded/by/foo'], function (somethingFooLoaded) {
    });

Or, if it was inside a package or directory, say bar/foo.js:

    require(['bar/foo!something/loaded/by/foo'], function (somethingFooLoaded) {
    });

Note that the text!, i18n! and order! plugins are "special" in that you only need to use a name like "text" to refer to it, instead of its full module name, "require/text". This was done to support old code that was authored before the Plugin API was fully fleshed out. You can use their full module name if you prefer: "require/text!path/to/dialog.html".

## Plugin API

RequireJS will load the plugin module first, then pass it the rest of the dependency name to a load() method on the plugin. There are also some methods to help with module name normalization and for making use of the plugin as part of the <a href="optimization.html">optimizer</a>.

The complete Plugin API:

<ul>
    <li><b>load</b>: A function that is called to load a resource. This is the only mandatory API method that needs to be implemented for the plugin to be useful.</li>
    <li><b>normalize</b>: A function to normalize the resource name. This is useful in providing optimal caching and optimization, but only needed if the resource name is not a module name.</li>
    <li><b>pluginBuilder</b>: A module name string for a module that should be used in the optimizer to do optimization work. That module is used instead of the plugin module when the optimizer runs.</li>
    <li><b>write</b>:
</ul>
