# RequireJS Optimization Tool

RequireJS comes with an optimization tool that does the following:

* Combines related scripts together into build layers and minifies them via Google Closure.
* (Coming Soon) optimizes CSS by inlining CSS files referenced by @import and removing comments and extra whitespace.
* Can add require.js and any of its plugins to any optimized build layer.
