- Need a domcontentloaded for IE, use the scrollLeft trick?

- Move to github

- loading more than one locale for a page. A locales= option?

- convertDojo.js: add in pause/resume when more than one provide is in the file.

- Caveat with .modify: you cannot modify the top-level function. We could remove
this restriction if we forced all functions to use the .apply() function wrapper.
So, choosing performance in this case over extensibility.

- Function modules are not identity-safe: hmm. what does that mean? Does it matter?
The issue being that for a circular dependency, the function method will actually
be a proxy method. So that function will not be the same in that module vs
another module. This could be a problem if some module was given that
module and does an if (varFunc === doFunc) sort of test, but that seems like a
rarity/less valuable than having function modules. Also could be a problem for
objects too, but again, only an issue in circular dependency cases, and the good
seems to outweigh the possibility of this edge case.

- Rhino tests.

- Build converters that can convert dojo and commonjs modules into runjs format.

- Allow custom build tool that collects a bunch of runjs modules into one file.
  - CSS optimization support (from dojo)?
