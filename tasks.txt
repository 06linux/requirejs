- Use a unit testing framework to verify test results instead of manual checks.

- Allow multiple versions of run.js to be loaded in a page, with the most recent
  version winning. However, need to transfer the state/contexts from old version
  to new version.

- Build converters that can convert dojo and commonjs modules into runjs format.

- Allow custom build tool that collects a bunch of runjs modules into one file.
  - CSS optimization support (from dojo)?
  - Flatten i18n bundles? "root" is already flattened, just need to do things like
    combine en with en-us and en-us-surfer.
