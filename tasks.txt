- Function modules are not identity-safe: hmm. what does that mean? Does it matter?
The issue being that for a circular dependency, the function method will actually
be a proxy method. So that function will not be the same in that module vs
another module. This could be a problem if some module was given that
module and does an if (varFunc === doFunc) sort of test.

- Convert paths to use / instead of .

nls stuff missing:
  - loading more than one locale for a page.

- Profile a run.js impl that does not do type checks for the args. Does it make a noticeable difference?

- convertDojo.js: add in pause/resume when more than one provide is in the file.

- Confirm that run([modifier], contextName); works, that the right context is used.

- The omega run call, if it does a "run" dependency tries to load version1/run.js. Hmm.

- The run plugin handling probably does not upgrade itself to use the latest version
  of run's plugins if two versions of run are on the page.

- Caveat with .modify: you cannot modify the top-level function. We could remove
this restriction if we forced all functions to use the .apply() function wrapper.
So, choosing performance in this case over extensibility.

- Rhino tests.

- Build converters that can convert dojo and commonjs modules into runjs format.

- Allow custom build tool that collects a bunch of runjs modules into one file.
  - CSS optimization support (from dojo)?
  - Flatten i18n bundles? "root" is already flattened, just need to do things like
    combine en with en-us and en-us-surfer.
