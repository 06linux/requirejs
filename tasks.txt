- Make sure the contextualRun has a .modify method that is modified!

- Does run([modifier], contextName); work, right context used?

- Add a run(function() {}) option that just waits until all modules loaded?

- Document the Function argument thing.

- Caveat with .modify: you cannot modify the top-level function. We could remove
this restriction if we forced all functions to use the .apply() function wrapper.
So, choosing performance in this case over extensibility.

- Use a unit testing framework to verify test results instead of manual checks.

- Allow multiple versions of run.js to be loaded in a page, with the most recent
  version winning. However, need to transfer the state/contexts from old version
  to new version.

- Build converters that can convert dojo and commonjs modules into runjs format.

- Allow custom build tool that collects a bunch of runjs modules into one file.
  - CSS optimization support (from dojo)?
  - Flatten i18n bundles? "root" is already flattened, just need to do things like
    combine en with en-us and en-us-surfer.
