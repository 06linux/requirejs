UglifyJS is under the BSD license, and it a third-party package.

* The contents of the package were modified to wrap the modules in a define() wrapper.
* The scripts in the original lib directory were just placed alongside index.js to allow for an easier path mapping.
* index.js was modified to use the ./ path instead of the ./lib/ path.
