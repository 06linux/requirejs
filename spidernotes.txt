1) In HTML, doing a require(["app"], function () {}),

the function will only be called if app.js uses define() to define itself vs. require.

2) No require.modify
- REMOVED from the docs!

3) No more pause/resume calls.

4) nameToUrl is different than toUrl, and toUrl *requires* the use of module
   names, cannot be optionally urls like what nameToUrl supports?

5) Support ifdef! plugin?

6) Pass config object to plugins? require.mixin, require.attach..
